# HDI-Clustering-System
This repository contains a Python implementation of a system for clustering countries based on their human development index (HDI) scores. The system is based on the Human Development Index dataset, which is a publicly available dataset of HDI scores for countries from 1991 to 2019.
The system is implemented using the following Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and, Sklearn.
The system first cleans the data and removes any null values. It then performs principal component analysis (PCA) on the data to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Finally, the system uses K-means clustering to cluster the countries into groups based on their HDI scores.
The system can be used to #Cluster countries based on their HDI scores, #Visualize the clusters of countries, #Identify the countries that are most similar to each other
The system is still under development, but it is already able to cluster countries with a high degree of accuracy. I plan to add more features to the system, such as the ability to predict future HDI scores for countries.
I hope you find this system useful!
